1. REST API calls,
2. Searching through a lambda function,
3. Searching the ES.

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::162492470455:role/Lambda-role" # Changing from "AWS" : "*"
      },
      "Action": "es:ESHttpGet", # Chnaging from "es:*" to the current 
      "Resource": "arn:aws:es:us-east-1:162492470455:domain/user-data/_search" # Changing from  user-data/* tp the current
    }
  ]
}
