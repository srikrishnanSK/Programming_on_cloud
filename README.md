The main goal of our project is to leverage the mentioned accessibility and create a web service mashed up with numerous cloud-based services which can be scaled and deployed on demand, change in requirement and feedback.
The platform being built allows users to make an appointment with a professional offering a home service such as carpentry, plumbing, home dÂ´ecor among many other services. The users can select professionals based on their experience,
specialization, availability, and their requirement. The user then initiates a request to the selected professional for a service through the application. The professional on
receiving the request can accept or decline the request. If a professional accepts a request, his/her profile will be shared
with the user and vice versa.

The Backend and Front End folder contains the respective details on how to proceed with the application.
